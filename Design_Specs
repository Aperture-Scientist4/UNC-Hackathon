Dear $Pronoun $Name,

Congratulations on officially starting your campaign for $Position in $county County.

The election is in $numWeeks weeks. 

During each week, a reporter will present you with a statement about an issue important to the community, and you will have to give a speech about the statement,
indicating whether you strongly agree with it, strongly disagree with it, or are somewhere in the middle.

Each stance you take will win you some voters and lose some others.

After $numWeeks weeks, the population will vote, and if you win at least 51% of the vote, you win the election!

Good luck!
